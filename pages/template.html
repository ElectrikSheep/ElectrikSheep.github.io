            <section class="topdesc">
               	An ASP.NET project built in Visual Studio with Cruze Computer Systems. My role for this project was as the lead/sole Graphic/Interface Designer as
                well as front-end (HTML and CSS) programmer.

                <p>
                Coach O was a somewhat local business targeting various sports functions: they sold bags, shirts, and other equipment as well as offering an online registration tool for Track &amp; Field tournaments.
                As part of my work with Cruze Computer Systems, we designed and built a new website for Coach O to allow for team-based sport tournament registration. The site would facilitate the event organizers by allowing
                them to create and maintain tournaments as well as collect payment for entry. For coaches, the site would allow team roster management as well as the ability to find and enter tournaments.

                <h3>Concepting</h3>
                <p>
                As the designer, I took part in the initial conversations to better understand the use-cases for the site so that I could design an intuitive interface to facilitate user flow and minimize errors, questions, and
                overall confusion. I also spent some time looking through the existing Track &amp; Field website, as many of the concepts were similar in nature. Initial concepting focused on the setup process for tournaments: this
                process required a gathering a great deal of information for tournaments as a whole and for specific divisions within a tournament.
                </p>

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>
                As with many projects, my workflow began in illustrator. I generally use illustrator because I find it more intuitive than photoshop and it allows me to concept in vector--and thus allows me to disregard the size of items
                in the initial stages as I look primarily at color and balance. I generally scatter the screen with various fonts and colors and use it as my digital drawing board that I can scroll around and compare various ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                For the Coach O site, I was given only one specific design constraint: the Coach O logo. This logo suggested a color scheme (and provided specific boundaries as to which colors to use). I opted for a minimal use
                of color to avoid overusing the bright red of the logo and opted for a deep blue as a complement in certain areas of the design. For the most part, I relied on typography and the use of some black&white iconography
                to define the interface. For typography, I landed on <a href="">Crimson</a>, a fantastic, open source font that is still evolving; strong and professional, I used it for headlines and had a beautiful italic variant that 
                I used in the buttons for the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                The tournament set-up process I seperated into three distinct steps, with a visual indicator of the steps at the top for a clear description of the process. The final step acts as both review and a stepping-stone
                for maintenance, if changes should be made later. 
                </p>

                <p>
                The other main interface was designed for the user's home page. Users could be connected to various teams or organizations and needed a clear way to interact with all of them from a single account. A tabular interface
                allowed a clear visual way for a user to interact with various elements in a simple way. This interface can be seen in the top image.
